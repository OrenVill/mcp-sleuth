# Pre-Release Checklist — mcp-sleuth

Use this skill before merging the release-please PR or publishing to npm.
Work through every section in order. Do not mark the release ready until all sections pass.

---

## 1. Static checks

Run all three in parallel — they are independent:

```bash
npm run build        # tsc -b + vite build → dist/
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # vitest run
```

All three must exit 0. A failing build means the published package is broken. A lint error or test failure blocks release.

---

## 2. CLI smoke test

Start the built output the way an end-user would (not the Vite dev server):

```bash
mcp-sleuth --no-open   # or: node bin/mcp-sleuth.js --no-open
```

Confirm:
- The process starts without error.
- It prints the ready line: `mcp-sleuth  ➜  http://127.0.0.1:4173/`
- `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4173/ | head -5` returns HTML (not an error page).

Then test the stop subcommand:

```bash
mcp-sleuth stop
```

Confirm the process exits cleanly and the lock file is removed (check `bin/mcp-sleuth.js` for the lock path).

**Why this matters:** The daemon/lock-file and stop subcommand were added in v0.6.0. If either is broken, the CLI is the user's primary entry point and the release is a regression.

---

## 3. npm publish dry run

```bash
npm publish --dry-run
```

Confirm:
- The tarball lists `dist/`, `bin/`, `server.js`, `README.md`.
- `README.md` in the tarball starts with the npm-focused install instructions (NOT the full GitHub README with a Layout section). This confirms the `prepublishOnly` swap script fired.
- No unexpected files (no `.claude/`, no `src/`, no `*.local`, no `.env`).

After the dry run completes, the `postpublish` script should have restored `README.md` to the GitHub variant. Verify:

```bash
head -20 README.md   # should show the full GitHub README, not the npm one
```

---

## 4. Playwright release suite

The fixture server at `http://localhost:3001/mcp` must be running before this step.

Run the full automated release suite:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/release/
```

All 95 tests must pass (4 conditional skips are acceptable — they fire only when the fixture server lacks a specific tool type). Any failure blocks the release.

The suite covers §3.1–3.21 of the release spec: initial load, server add/error, tab bar, fixture connection, tool forms, result pane rendering, call history diff, bookmarks persistence, cross-server search, export dialog, meta-tool discovery, resources tab, prompts tab, Protocol Inspector, Replay Suites, Schema Lab, Agent Readiness, Client Config Export, Handoff README, and Scenario Runner.

---

## 5. CHANGELOG and version

> **Note:** `CHANGELOG.md` and the `version` field in `package.json` are managed automatically by release-please after the agent approves the release PR. You do not need to edit them manually — just confirm they look correct before approving.

- Open `CHANGELOG.md` — confirm the top section matches the version being released and lists all merged PRs/commits since the last tag.
- Open `package.json` — confirm `"version"` matches.
- Confirm `README.md` (GitHub version) and `README.npm.md` (npm version) reflect any new commands or features in this release.

---

## 6. Final gate

All of the above pass → merge the release-please PR. The GitHub Action will:
1. Tag the commit (`vX.Y.Z`)
2. Create a GitHub Release with the changelog section
3. Run `npm publish` (which fires `prepublishOnly` → swaps README → publishes → `postpublish` → restores README)

After the Action completes, verify:
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orenvill/mcp-sleuth` shows the new version, and the README displayed is the npm-focused one (starts with install instructions, not the Layout section).
- In a clean shell: `npm install -g @orenvill/mcp-sleuth@latest` → `mcp-sleuth` → confirms it opens the browser correctly.
