# Pre-Release Checklist — mcp-sleuth

Use this skill before merging the release-please PR or publishing to npm.
Work through every section in order. Do not mark the release ready until all sections pass.

---

## 1. Static checks

Run all three in parallel — they are independent:

```bash
npm run build        # tsc -b + vite build → dist/
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # vitest run
```

All three must exit 0. A failing build means the published package is broken. A lint error or test failure blocks release.

---

## 2. CLI smoke test

Start the built output the way an end-user would (not the Vite dev server):

```bash
mcp-sleuth --no-open   # or: node bin/mcp-sleuth.js --no-open
```

Confirm:
- The process starts without error.
- It prints the ready line: `mcp-sleuth  ➜  http://127.0.0.1:4173/`
- `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4173/ | head -5` returns HTML (not an error page).

Then test the stop subcommand:

```bash
mcp-sleuth stop
```

Confirm the process exits cleanly and the lock file is removed (check `bin/mcp-sleuth.js` for the lock path).

**Why this matters:** The daemon/lock-file and stop subcommand were added in v0.6.0. If either is broken, the CLI is the user's primary entry point and the release is a regression.

---

## 3. Playwright release suite

Playwright starts both servers itself — the static server on `127.0.0.1:4173` and the
MCP fixture on `127.0.0.1:3001` (`tests/fixtures/http-mcp-server.mjs`). No manual setup
is needed. To run the fixture on its own while debugging:

```bash
node tests/fixtures/http-mcp-server.mjs
```

Run the full automated release suite:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/release/
```

All 99 tests must pass. Any failure blocks the release.

Two specs additionally connect to an external MCP server on the LAN
(`AWESOME_URL` in `tests/release/helpers.ts`): §3.6 (boolean-param tool) and §3.12
(meta-tool discovery). If that host is unreachable those two specs fail — check it
before assuming a regression.

The suite covers §3.1–3.22 of the release spec: initial load, server add/error, tab bar,
fixture connection, tool forms, result pane rendering, call history diff, bookmarks
persistence, cross-server search, export dialog, meta-tool discovery, resources tab,
prompts tab, Protocol Inspector, Replay Suites, Schema Lab, Agent Readiness, Client
Config Export, Handoff README, Scenario Runner, stdio transport (local bridge + echo
tool), and Trust evaluators (Permission Surface, Prompt Injection scan, Observation
Journal).

**Fixture content is load-bearing.** `http-mcp-server.mjs` documents which spec depends
on each tool, resource, and prompt it registers — read that header before changing it.
In particular no name or description may contain the word "fixture", because
`helpers.ts` locates the server row with a case-insensitive `hasText: 'Fixture'` match.

**§3.22 — Stdio transport (manual pass):** Add a stdio server with command `node` (or `process.execPath`) and args pointing at `tests/fixtures/stdio-mcp-server.mjs`; confirm the sidebar shows connected (green dot), the `echo` tool appears, invoking with a message returns that text in the result pane, and disconnect/reconnect still works. Automated: `tests/release/22-stdio-transport.spec.ts` (no HTTP fixture server required).

---

## 4. CHANGELOG and version

> **Note:** `CHANGELOG.md` and the `version` field in `package.json` are managed automatically by release-please after the agent approves the release PR. You do not need to edit them manually — just confirm they look correct before approving.

- Open `CHANGELOG.md` — confirm the top section matches the version being released and lists all merged PRs/commits since the last tag.
- Open `package.json` — confirm `"version"` matches.
- Confirm `README.md` (GitHub version) and `README.npm.md` (npm version) reflect any new commands or features in this release.

---

## 5. Final gate

All of the above pass → merge the release-please PR. The GitHub Action will:
1. Tag the commit (`vX.Y.Z`)
2. Create a GitHub Release with the changelog section
3. Run `npm publish` (which fires `prepublishOnly` → swaps README → publishes → `postpublish` → restores README)

After the Action completes, verify:
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orenvill/mcp-sleuth` shows the new version, and the README displayed is the npm-focused one (starts with install instructions, not the Layout section).
- In a clean shell: `npm install -g @orenvill/mcp-sleuth@latest` → `mcp-sleuth` → confirms it opens the browser correctly.
